The synthetic dataset used here is coming from Magicoder,

## Magicoder
* ðŸŽ©**Magicoder** is a model family empowered by ðŸª„**OSS-Instruct**, a novel approach to enlightening LLMs with open-source code snippets for generating *low-bias* and *high-quality* instruction data for code.
* ðŸª„**OSS-Instruct** mitigates the *inherent bias* of the LLM-synthesized instruction data by empowering them with *a wealth of open-source references* to produce more diverse, realistic, and controllable data.
